# CS-456 - Artificial Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning
# Mini-project: From Discrete to Continuous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

This a repository containing the necessary code to reproduce the results and plots used in the corresponding report. 
- Each agent is trained in his separate notebook called ```agentx.ipynb```.
- All agents and logged data used for plots can be loaded from the folders called ```agentx_data``` with pickle. 
- To reproduce this data/agents, simply run the training cells in each notebook with the correct seed list (each folder has the list in the ```seeds.txt``` file).
